\subsection{Double limits in $\eps$ and $\delta$.} \label{ssec:Intro-DoubleLimits}
So far we have considered the result of a shrinking domain thickness given fixed material properties, and then various asymptotic limits of high contrast materials with fixed inclusion sizes. 
It is natural to ask whether any consideration has been put into considering the effects that might emerge when both the (relative) size $\delta$ of the region $Q_1$ shrinks to zero \emph{and} the contrast in the material properties increases to infinity.
The series of papers \cite{figotin1996band-scalar, figotin1996band-maxwell, figotin1998spectral} was dedicated to investigating the spectral properties that emerge in the aforementioned limits, for a variety of operators relevant to models of wave propagation.
This series begins \cite{figotin1996band-scalar} by studying the acoustic equation on a non-magnetic composite material whose period cell $Q$ is the unit square in $\reals^2$, and whose inclusion $Q_0$ is a smaller square of side length $1-\delta$.
The region $Q_1$ is therefore shrinking as $\delta\rightarrow0$ (visually, to a singular structure) and possesses (``dimensionless") dielectric constant $\eps_m$ which is equal to $\eps$ on $Q_1$ and $1$ on $Q_0$.
For sufficiently small values of $\delta$, $\bracs{\delta\eps}^{-1}$, and $\eps\delta^2$, it is demonstrated that spectral gaps open, that the spectrum concentrates near the eigenvalues of the Neumann Laplacian on (the union of all periodic translations of) $Q_0$, and an estimate for the width of the spectral bands is also provided.
This was followed up \cite{figotin1996band-maxwell} by a consideration of the curl-of-the-curl equation in $\reals^3$, on a domain that was the extrusion into 3 dimensions of the 2D domain described previously.
In the asymptotic regime $\eps\delta^{\frac{3}{2}}\ll 1$, $\eps\delta\gg1$, gaps in the spectrum once again begin to open --- details on the structure of the spectrum and estimates regarding the width of the spectral bands are again provided.
Finally, analysis of the acoustic equation when the region $Q_0$ was a polygon \cite{figotin1998spectral} was considered, in the limit as $\delta\rightarrow0$, and $\bracs{\delta\eps}^{-1}\rightarrow W<\infty$.
Note that since the region $Q_0$ is a polygon, the region $Q_1$ can be thought of as a thickening of some graph $\graph$ embedded into $\reals^2$.
Under these assumptions, it is shown that the spectrum of the acoustic equation on such a medium converges to the spectrum of the problem
\begin{align} \label{eq:Intro-KuchFigQGLimit}
	-\laplacian u &= \lambda\bracs{\delta_{\graph} + W}u,
\end{align}
where $\lambda$ is the spectral parameter and $\delta_{\graph}$ is the delta function supporting the graph $\graph$.
Note that this convergence is not in the norm-resolvent sense, and only demonstrates coincidence of the limit of the acoustic equation as $\delta\rightarrow0$, $\bracs{\delta\eps}^{-1}\rightarrow W<\infty$ with the spectrum of the problem \eqref{eq:Intro-KuchFigQGLimit}.
This is of particular interest to our work in chapter \ref{ch:SingInc}, where we will consider a composite medium with one of the components being a singular structure, and look to obtain (and solve) a non-local quantum graph problem from our singular structure formulation.
However we note that our approach via singular structures is motivated by geometric contrasts, rather than the combination of geometric and material contrasts that these studies consider.
\tstk{anything that goes beyond these studies regarding the double limit? I don't think there is.}
