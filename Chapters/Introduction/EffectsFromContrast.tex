\section{Asymptotic Limits and Dispersive Effects} \label{sec:AsymptoticStudies}
We have introduced a typical domain setup and set of dimensionless parameters that one might consider when studying (electromagnetic) wave propagation in PCs.
Now we turn our attention to the behaviour of such waves, and the structure of the corresponding spectra and band-gaps, in various regimes of these parameters.
There is an important distinction for us to make here between geometric and material properties.
Using \eqref{eq:Intro-NonDimMaxwellLengths} as an example, the parameters $\tilde{L}, \delta$ pertain to a description of the geometry of the PC --- changing these parameters does not alter the properties intrinsic to the materials that make up the composite, only their relative size within the period cell compared to the wavelength of incident light.
Conversely, the bulk and inclusion wavelengths correspond to material properties of the PC and how these interact with incoming light --- changing these corresponds to changing the physical materials that the PC is made from, but does not change the arrangement of the materials within the period cell itself.
This also provides a natural split between the various regimes that can be considered; fixed material properties with the geometry varying, fixed geometry with varying permittivities, or simultaneous limits in both.
The former consideration takes us to the realm of thin structures shrinking to singular structures, and the quantum graph problems that describe the limiting behaviour, which is the topic of section \ref{ssec:Intro-ThinStructures}.
To study the other regimes, we are naturally guided us towards the techniques of homogenisation theory to derive ``limiting" problems and study the resulting effects that emerge, as a result of the contrast between the dimensionless parameters.

\subsection{Double limits in geometric and material parameters} \label{ssec:Intro-DoubleLimits}
So far we have considered the results of a shrinking domain thickness given fixed material properties (section \ref{ssec:Intro-ThinStructures}), and then various asymptotic limits of high contrast materials with fixed inclusion sizes (section \ref{ssec:Intro-CritContrast}). 
It is natural to ask whether any consideration has been put into considering the effects that might emerge when both the (relative) size $\delta$ of the region $Q_1$ shrinks to zero \emph{and} the contrast in the material parameters simultaneously increases to infinity.
The series of papers \cite{figotin1996band-scalar, figotin1996band-maxwell, figotin1998spectral} was dedicated to investigating the spectral properties that emerge in the aforementioned limits, for a variety of operators relevant to models of wave propagation.
This series begins with \cite{figotin1996band-scalar}, studying the acoustic equation on a non-magnetic composite material whose period cell $Q$ is the unit square in $\reals^2$, and whose inclusion $Q_0$ is a smaller square of side length $1-\delta$ --- the setup is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:Diagram_KF-DoubleLimitStudy}.
\begin{figure}[b!]

Simultaneous limits of the material parameters and geometric parameters were considered, although contrast between the edge and vertex volumes of the region $\widetilde{Q}_1$ were absent.}
\end{figure}
The region $Q_1$ is therefore shrinking as $\delta\rightarrow0$ (visually, to a singular structure) and possesses (relative) dielectric constant $\epsilon_r$ which is equal to $\eps$ on $Q_1$ and $1$ on $Q_0$.
For sufficiently small values of $\delta$, $\bracs{\delta\eps}^{-1}$, and $\eps\delta^2$, it is demonstrated that spectral gaps open, that the spectrum concentrates near the eigenvalues of the Neumann Laplacian on (the union of all periodic translations of) $Q_0$, and an estimate for the width of the spectral bands is also provided.
This was followed up \cite{figotin1996band-maxwell} by a consideration of the curl-of-the-curl equation in $\reals^3$, on a domain that was the extrusion into 3 dimensions of the 2D domain described previously.
In the asymptotic regime $\eps\delta^{\frac{3}{2}}\ll 1$, $\eps\delta\gg1$, gaps in the spectrum once again begin to open --- details on the structure of the spectrum and estimates regarding the width of the spectral bands are again provided.
Finally, analysis of the acoustic equation when the region $Q_0$ was a polygon \cite{figotin1998spectral} was considered, in the limit as $\delta\rightarrow0$, and $\bracs{\delta\eps}^{-1}\rightarrow W<\infty$.
Note that since the region $Q_0$ is a polygon, the region $Q_1$ can be thought of as a thickening of some graph $\graph$ embedded into $\reals^2$.
Under these assumptions, it is shown that the spectrum of the acoustic equation on such a medium converges to the spectrum of the problem
\begin{align} \label{eq:Intro-KuchFigQGLimit}
	-\laplacian u &= \lambda\bracs{\delta_{\graph} + W}u,
\end{align}
where $\lambda$ is the spectral parameter and $\delta_{\graph}$ is the delta function supporting the graph $\graph$.
Note that this convergence is not in the norm-resolvent sense, and only demonstrates coincidence of the limit of the acoustic equation as $\delta\rightarrow0$, $\bracs{\delta\eps}^{-1}\rightarrow W<\infty$ with the spectrum of the problem \eqref{eq:Intro-KuchFigQGLimit}.
This is of particular interest to our work in chapter \ref{ch:SingInc}, where we will consider a composite medium with one of the components being a singular structure, and look to obtain (and solve) a non-local quantum graph problem from our singular structure formulation.
A similar setup has been studied for materials at high contrast in the context of linear elasticity in \cite{cherednichenko2019homogenisation}; again the domain consists of a periodic structure with $Q_1$ composed of thin rods of width $\delta$ and whose material parameter $\lambda^{\mathrm{bulk}}=O(\delta^2)$, whilst $\lambda^{\mathrm{inc}}=O(1)$ in the surrounding inclusions $Q_0$.
This work establishes convergence of the solutions to the resolvent problem in the two-scale sense (introduced in \cite{zhikov2000extension}), and conducts further analysis to establish convergence of the spectra to that of the ``two-scale" limit operator.

None of the studies thus described not consider the possible relations between the vertex and edge volume of the ``thickened graph" region $Q_1$ as $\delta\rightarrow0$, and as a result such a geometric parameter is absent from the analysis and resulting equations.
Our approach via singular structures is motivated by such geometric contrasts, although we shall see that we can incorporate material contrast into the problems we study in chapter \ref{ch:SingInc}.
We also have a more geometrically motivated starting point in mind; our choice to start from a measure-theoretic formulation reflects the different length scales of the components of the ``limit" material, and we expect to see effects due to contrast emerge through the interactions of these length scales.
