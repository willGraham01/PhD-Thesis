\section{Asymptotic Studies and Dispersive Effects} 
\tstk{Rename when you get the chance, to something more appropriate}

\tstk{linking intro too; here we are going to motivate the idea of critical contrast and how it causes band-gaps and other effects to emerge, when the size of the inclusion is fixed. This will then be a natural point to talk about some of the missing gaps WRT K-Fig studies and the missing ``homogenisation" problem? Then we'll talk about thickened graphs and the limit as width goes to zero. This will motivate our singular structures, and also show that dissipative effects can emerge from geometric, as well as material, properties. Then, this should provide a natural segway into what we are planning to talk about: our starting point of singular structures to introduce contrast effects, the gaps in the literature that this work is related to (is this the limiting problem of some other system?), and our objectives in carrying out this research}

% include the discussion on thin structures
\input{./Chapters/Introduction/Intro-SSThinStructures.tex}

% now begin the discussion of critical contrast
\input{./Chapters/Introduction/Intro-CriticalContrastResonance.tex}

% finally, talk about when both $\delta$ and $\eps$ are present, and lead into Research Overview
\subsection{Double limits in $\eps$ and $\delta$.} \label{ssec:Intro-DoubleLimits}
