\section{Asymptotic Studies and Dispersive Effects} 
\tstk{Rename when you get the chance, to something more appropriate}

\tstk{linking intro too; here we are going to motivate the idea of critical contrast and how it causes band-gaps and other effects to emerge, when the size of the inclusion is fixed. This will then be a natural point to talk about some of the missing gaps WRT K-Fig studies and the missing ``homogenisation" problem? Then we'll talk about thickened graphs and the limit as width goes to zero. This will motivate our singular structures, and also show that dissipative effects can emerge from geometric, as well as material, properties. Then, this should provide a natural segway into what we are planning to talk about: our starting point of singular structures to introduce contrast effects, the gaps in the literature that this work is related to (is this the limiting problem of some other system?), and our objectives in carrying out this research}

\subsection{Critical Contrast}
\tstk{linking sentence}

Let us begin with the study of \cite{zhikov2000extension}, that was concerned with the homogenisation problem for the operator $\mathcal{A}^{\eps}$,
\begin{align*}
	\mathcal{A}^{\eps} := -\grad\cdot A^{\eps}(\eps^{-1}x)\grad,
\end{align*}
in the limit as $\eps\rightarrow0$, where $A^{\eps}(y)$ is a $Q=[0,1)^d$-periodic function taking the value $\eps^2$ on $Q_0$ and $1$ on $Q_1$ (see the bottom-left domain in figure \ref{fig:Diagram_HL-Zhikov}).
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{Diagram_HL-Zhikov.pdf}
	\caption{\label{fig:Diagram_HL-Zhikov} An illustration of how homogenisation of materials under critical contrast interlaces with asymptotic studies of photonic crystal-like materials.}
\end{figure}
A limiting operator $\mathcal{A}$ is derived, and the convergence of the solutions to $\mathcal{A}^{\eps}u^{\eps}=f^{\eps}$ to the solution $u$ of $\mathcal{A}u=f$ is obtained --- this convergence being in the so-called two-scale sense \tstk{rather than what? The classical homogenisation arguments that lead to resolvent convergence?}.
The spectrum of the limiting operator $\mathcal{A}$ is also shown to be the Hausdorff limit of the spectra of the operators $\mathcal{A}^{\eps}$ as $\eps\rightarrow0$.
Crucially, the limiting operator $\mathcal{A}$ possesses an infinite set of spectral band-gaps, whose location is described by a function $\beta\bracs{\omega}$.
The existence of gaps in the limiting spectrum is unusual, and can be attributed to the matrix $A^{\eps}$ itself being dependent on $\eps^2$.
Indeed, suppose we were to consider the similar homogenisation problem for the operators
\begin{align*}
	\mathcal{B}^{\eps} := -\grad\cdot B(\eps^{-1}x)\grad,
\end{align*}
again as $\eps\rightarrow0$, but with $B(y)$ identical to $A(y)$ except taking the value $b\neq b(\eps)$ on $Q_1$.
Setting $y=\eps^{-1}x$, we find that
\begin{align*}
	\mathcal{B}^{\eps}u = \omega^2 u 
	\quad\Leftrightarrow \quad &
	-\recip{\eps^2}\grad\cdot B(y)\grad u = \omega^2 u, \\
	\quad\Leftrightarrow \quad &
	-\grad\cdot B(y)\grad u = \nu^2 u,
\end{align*}
where $\nu = \omega\eps$.
The operator $-\grad\cdot B(y)\grad u$ has $[0,1)^d$-periodic coefficients, and acts on the domain with period cell as illustrated on the right of figure \ref{fig:Diagram_HL-Zhikov}.
Due to the periodic coefficients, the spectrum and thus eigenvalues $\nu^2$ will form (possibly overlapping) bands --- so in the limit $\eps\rightarrow0$ and with $\omega = \eps^{-1}\nu$, the spectrum of $\mathcal{B}^{\eps}$ extends to the positive real line as one ``inflates" the bands by $\eps^{-2}$.
Consequentially we don't observe band-gaps in the limiting operator for $\mathcal{B}^{\eps}$, as the first band in particular is stretched to cover the whole real line.
However by ensuring that $b$ scales with the parameter $\eps$ in a particular way, we \emph{do} observe band-gaps (and additional phenomena such as time-memory).
This introduces us to the idea of \emph{critical contrast} or \emph{high contrast}; a material whose parameters are scaled in proportion to the size of the period cell is said to be under \emph{critical contrast}. \tstk{also resonnance????}

The question now is how do materials under critical contrast relate to the finite-periodic, composite materials (the notation for which we adopt from section \ref{sec:Intro-Maxwell})?
To address this, we turn to the study of \cite{hempel2000spectral} who studied a periodic composite material with the setup in the top-left of figure \ref{fig:Diagram_HL-Zhikov}; here the period cell and inclusion are of a fixed size, and the operator $\mathcal{A}^\kappa:=-\grad\cdot\tilde{A}\grad$ is studied\footnote{\tstk{H and L} actually study a slightly more general version of this operator.} where $A=1$ on $Q_0$ and $A=\kappa\gg 1$ on $Q_1$.
The asymptotic limit $\kappa\rightarrow\infty$ was then explored --- physically, this corresponds to our expectation that low-index inclusions need to be surrounded by a high-index bulk material to open spectral band-gaps.
Writing the spectrum of $\mathcal{A}^\kappa$ as the set
\begin{align*}
	\sigma\bracs{\mathcal{A}^\kappa} = \bigcup_{i\in\naturals}\sqbracs{a_i^\kappa,b_i^\kappa},
\end{align*}
for (possibly overlapping) bands $I_i^\kappa = \sqbracs{a_i^\kappa,b_i^\kappa}$, it was shown that there exist constants $\alpha_i < \beta_i < \alpha_{i+1}$ such that
\begin{align*}
	a_i^\kappa \rightarrow \alpha_i, \qquad b_i^\kappa \rightarrow \beta_i, \qquad \toInfty{\kappa}.
\end{align*}
The analysis also demonstrated that the $\beta_i$ were the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet Laplacian on $\bigcup_{i\in\integers^d}Q_0$, and the $\alpha_i$ the limits (as $\kappa\rightarrow\infty$) of the eigenvalues of the operator with action $-\grad\cdot \tilde{A}\grad u$ with domain $Q_0$, under Neumann boundary conditions.
Additional results about the density of states were also proven, the main takeaway being that the spectrum concentrates near the endpoints $\beta_i$ of the bands as $\kappa$ increases. \tstk{follow up studies? Friedlander, etc}
Importantly, this limit of the spectrum is the same as that of the aforementioned limiting operator $\mathcal{B}$.
Indeed, upon identifying $\kappa=\eps^{-2}$ (so $\kappa\rightarrow\infty \Leftrightarrow \eps\rightarrow0$) and $\tilde{A}=\eps^{-2}B$ it is clear why the two problems share the same spectrum under the respective limits, although it should be noted that this is one of the only common features of the two problems --- in most other respects they behave differently.
\tstk{here, we could also introduce resonance WRT Hempel-Lienau, the inclusion parameter being 1 and the off-inclusion parameter being far greater than 1. Also, this links back to the physical interpretation that PCFs work through anti-resonances...}
This is also an opportune time for us to introduce the concept of resonance; a material experiences resonance when exactly one of the non-dimensional parameters is of order unity, and the remainder are much larger than unity.
In the setup of \cite{hempel2000spectral} we observe precisely this situation --- we have $\lambda^{\mathrm{bulk}}\gg L$, whilst $\lambda^{\mathrm{inc}}\sim L$ (the parameter $\delta$ is absent from this formulation as a variable sized inclusion was not considered).
One can then attribute resonance to the emergence of band-gaps \tstk{and other dissipative stuff} in the asymptotic limit, with the vast differences in wavelengths in each of the material components that are required becoming impossible to achieve at higher contrasts.

\tstk{Now, we can talk about what happens if we free up $\delta$, or if we want to look at the Maxwell or curl-curl operator instead. This will lead us into talking about the results of Kuchment-Figotin, although the other two ``parts" of the picture in figure 1-4 are missing. Other possible references that are important here are:}
