\subsection{Critical contrast (or high contrast) composites} \label{ssec:Intro-CritContrast}
We have seen that there are a variety of effective problems that one can obtain from the zero thickness limit of a thin structure in section \ref{ssec:Intro-ThinStructures} --- in particular how a contrast between the vertex and edge regions gives rise to non-standard (and unexpected) limiting problems.
Rather than considering limits of the geometric parameters, we now turn our attention to various studies that have focused on asymptotic regimes of the material parameters.
These studies concern periodic, composite materials whose domains are described in the manner introduced in section \ref{ssec:Intro-NonDimMax}, however with the size of the inclusion $\delta$ fixed.
Such domains are more reflective of PCs than the thin domains previously considered in section \ref{ssec:Intro-ThinStructures}, by virtue of the presence of the inclusion $Q_0$ in the structure. 
Although our studies will start from the singular ``$\delta=0$" structure corresponding to such domains, it is nonetheless important for us to highlight how asymptotic models for materials possessing material contrast can also give rise to dispersive effects, which mirror those that arise from limits of thin structures.

Studies of periodic, composite materials typically rely on techniques from homogenisation theory to determine ``effective" material properties in the asymptotic limit of interest.
Let us consider the operator $\mathcal{A}=-\grad\cdot A\grad$ on the (non-dimensional) domain described in figure \ref{fig:Diagram_ScalingDimensionless}, section \ref{sec:Intro-Maxwell}, with $\delta$ fixed to some value, and the (possibly matrix-valued) $Q$-periodic function $A$ describing the non-dimensional material parameters.
One regime of interest is the ``long wave" (or low frequency) regime when $\tilde{L}\ll 1$, where one attempts to garner information about the lowest spectral band of a composite material.
To be consistent with the notation in the literature, the (small) parameter $\eps:=\tilde{L}\ll 1$ is introduced and we consider the (sequence of) operators $\mathcal{A}^{\eps} = -\grad\cdot A\bracs{\eps^{-1}x}\grad$ in the limit $\eps\rightarrow0$.
The typical approach is to then derive an ``effective" operator $\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{hom}} = -\grad\cdot A^{\mathrm{hom}}\grad$ (via the method of asymptotic expansions) that describes the resulting limit, and look to formalise the relationship between $\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{hom}}$ and $\mathcal{A}^{\eps}$ through convergence results.
Typically one desires convergence of $\mathcal{A}^{\eps}$ to $\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{hom}}$ as $\eps\rightarrow0$ in the norm-resolvent sense, namely that the family of solutions $u_{\eps}$ to the problems $\mathcal{A}^{\eps}u_{\eps}=f_{\eps}$ converges to the solution $u$ of the effective problem $\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{hom}}u = f$, for any suitable initial data $f_{\eps}\rightarrow f$.
However one may be interested in spectral results, namely coincidence $\sigma\bracs{\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{hom}}}$ with the limit of $\sigma\bracs{\mathcal{A}^{\eps}}$ (akin to the results for thin structures discussed in section \ref{ssec:Intro-ThinStructures}) which would otherwise be implied by norm-resolvent convergence.
Establishing such convergence results ensures that the effective problem faithfully describes the behaviour of the composite material within this asymptotic regime.

It is worth remarking here that one typically sees interest in the spectral properties of the effective problem in studies working in the electromagnetic context, whilst the resolvent problem typically receives more interest in an elastic context.
This is predominantly due to the fact that the Maxwell system (especially after seeking time-harmonic solutions, see section \ref{sec:Intro-Maxwell}) is \emph{already} posed as an eigenvalue problem --- whilst we could consider the resolvent problem for the Maxwell operator, such a problem does not model any electromagnetic phenomena.
One encounters the opposite situation in the elastic setting, although norm-resolvent convergence implies spectral convergence too, so it is not as uncommon to see spectral results in this context.

The matrix $A^{\mathrm{hom}}$ is labelled or interpreted as the ``effective" material properties; studies into the various asymptotic regimes can reveal interesting behaviours that are not expected or realised in other regimes.
In the context of PCs, the design of materials under certain parameter regimes to open spectral band gaps is one such effect that is desired.
However other dispersive effects such as metamaterial behaviour --- where the effective material properties appear to take unphysical values such as negative refractive indices --- can also emerge from these limits, and give rise to unexpected and seemingly unphysical behaviours.
For such effects to be realised, one typically expects to obtain an effective problem where $A^{\mathrm{hom}}$ depends non-trivially on the frequency variable $\omega$.
As such, behaviours of the propagating waves and the spectra that emerge due to frequency-dependence of the material parameters are collectively referred to as dispersive effects.

The asymptotic treatment of composite materials has seen considerable interest due to the aforementioned motivations.
However, it has been known to both the mathematical and physical community for some time that the toolbox of standard homogenisation theory is unable to capture the correct asymptotic behaviour for composite materials.
It has been reported (\cite{cherednichenko2019unified}, in reference to the results of \cite{birman2004second} and \cite{zhikov1989spectral}) that if the matrix $\mathcal{A}(\eps^{-1}x)$ and its inverse are uniformly bounded (the ``uniformly elliptic" setting), that the resulting effective problem has $A^{\mathrm{hom}}$ being a constant matrix, which leaves no room for dispersive effects to emerge.
However such a setup does not allow for the material parameters $\lambda^{\mathrm{inc}},\lambda^{\mathrm{bulk}}$ to also scale with $\eps$.
If one allows for such a scaling, the resulting analysis becomes more complicated and the standard asymptotic techniques are longer capable of describing (or deriving) the effective problem.
The inadequacy of standard techniques in such contexts has been reported in works such as \cite{nicorovici1995photonic}, which highlighted ``non-commuting limits" when considering wave scattering off a periodic composite material.
In such a problem there are two scales to consider; the wavenumber of the incident wave $\wavenumber$ and the refractive index of the inclusions within the composite, $N$ (which is proportional to the square root of the relative electric permittivity of the inclusions, to maintain a connection to the dimensionless quantities introduced in section \ref{sec:Intro-Maxwell}).
In order to study the first spectral band\footnote{This is also referred to as the lowest spectral band, or the ``acoustic band" in the literature.} in the case when the inclusions are highly conducting; we can either consider the case when the inclusions are perfectly conducting ($N\rightarrow\infty$) for fixed $\wavenumber$ and then take the ``static-limit" $\wavenumber\rightarrow0$, \emph{or} consider the static limit ($\wavenumber\rightarrow0$) at a high but finite refractive index and then take $N\rightarrow\infty$.
However the two approaches produce different effective materials --- the explanation provided in \cite{movchan2001noncommuting} is that the trajectory in $\bracs{N^{-1},\wavenumber}$-space that one takes as these values approach the origin must be of the form $N^{-1}=\wavenumber^p$, with $p<1$ for homogenisation to be satisfactory, otherwise the problem being considered is ``singularly perturbed" and boundary layer effects emerge near the inclusion-matrix interface which are not handled by the homogenisation process.
However, there have been a number of developments aimed at expanding the tools of homogenisation theory to handle contexts such as the above, where the material parameters scale in particular relation to the size of an incident wave or the size of the period cell.

Let us begin with the study of \cite{zhikov2000extension}, that was concerned with the homogenisation problem for the operator $\mathcal{A}^{\eps}$,
\begin{align*}
	\mathcal{A}^{\eps} := -\grad\cdot A^{\eps}(\eps^{-1}x)\grad,
\end{align*}
in the limit as $\eps\rightarrow0$, where $A^{\eps}(y)=\eps^2$ on $Q_0$ and $1$ on $Q_1$\footnote{This setup corresponds to a periodic structure with low-index inclusions, as opposed to the high-index inclusions considered in \cite{movchan2001noncommuting}.}, see the domain on the left in figure \ref{fig:Diagram_HL-Zhikov}.
\begin{figure}[b]

	\caption[Relation between materials under critical contrast and at resonance.]{\label{fig:Diagram_HL-Zhikov} A material under critical contrast (left) as studied in \cite{zhikov2000extension}, and a material at resonance studied in \cite{hempel2000spectral} (right).}
\end{figure}
Materials such as this are said to be under \emph{critical contrast} (also referred to as \emph{high contrast}); the material parameter $\lambda^{\mathrm{inc}}$ scales in proportion to the size of the period cell $\eps$, analogous to (although not exactly) the relation between refractive index and incident wave-number mentioned earlier.
A limiting operator $\mathcal{A}$, and the convergence of the solutions to $\mathcal{A}^{\eps}u^{\eps}=f^{\eps}$ to the solution $u$ of $\mathcal{A}u=f$ is obtained --- however this convergence is in the so-called two-scale sense (see \cite[section 2]{zhikov2000extension}, or \cite{bouchitte2001homogenization}) rather than the standard norm-resolvent sense of classical homogenisation.
The spectrum of the limiting operator $\mathcal{A}$ is however shown to be the Hausdorff limit of the spectra of the operators $\mathcal{A}^{\eps}$ as $\eps\rightarrow0$, and demonstrates dispersive properties such as band gaps.
It is argued (and demonstrated) that two-scale convergence ensures that not only do the solutions $u^{\eps}$ converge to $u$, but the energy of the system also converges (in this two-scale sense) to the energy of the effective problem --- something which is not always guaranteed by classical homogenisation in contexts such as this.
Furthermore, it is also demonstrated that if $A^{\eps}(y)\propto\eps^p$ on $Q_0$ for $p<2$, the effective problem coincides with that obtained through classical homogenisation, whilst for $p\geq 2$ the effective problem is a two-scale limit of the original problem.
This provides a method of obtaining an effective problem for materials under critical contrast, and assurance that the effective problem is an approximation (in the two-scale sense) of such materials, where previous homogenisation techniques fell short.
Albeit that the two-scale convergence obtained is not the standard norm-resolvent convergence we get from classical homogenisation.
Two-scale convergence has since been employed in the study \cite{kamotski2018localized} to prove that introducing a defect (or core) into a PC can introduces frequencies into the spectrum of the effective problem within one of the spectral gaps, with the corresponding modes being localised to the defect.
This a mathematical confirmation that PCs manufactured to be under critical contrast can be exploited as a means of guiding light.

In a related development, the study \cite{hempel2000spectral} considered the domain illustrated in the right of figure \ref{fig:Diagram_HL-Zhikov}.
There is no small parameter in this study; the period cell \emph{and} inclusion are of a fixed size, and the operator considered is $\widetilde{\mathcal{A}}^\sigma:=-\grad\cdot\tilde{A}\grad$ is studied\footnote{The study \cite{hempel2000spectral} actually concerns a slightly more general version of this operator.} where $\widetilde{A}=1$ on $Q_0$ and $\widetilde{A}=\sigma\gg 1$ on $Q_1$.
The asymptotic limit $\sigma\rightarrow\infty$ was then explored, with the proof that the spectrum of the effective problem exhibits band gaps, and that the endpoints of the spectral bands correspond to the Dirchlet and (the limits of the) Neumann eigenvalues of the Laplacian on the inclusions $Q_0$.
Additional results about the density of states were also proven, the main takeaway being that the spectrum concentrates near the right-endpoints of the bands as $\sigma$ increases. 
These results are also proved in \cite{friedlander2002density} under slightly stricter assumptions concerning smoothness of the boundary of the inclusion $Q_0$, but providing an asymptotic form for the integrated density of states --- this asymptotic form for the integrated density of states is further refined in \cite{selden2005periodic}. 
Upon identifying $\sigma=\eps^{-2}$ (so $\sigma\rightarrow\infty \Leftrightarrow \eps\rightarrow0$) it is clear why the effective problems for $\mathcal{A}^{\eps}$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{A}}^{\sigma}$ (under the respective limits) possess qualitatively the same spectra, although it should be noted that this is one of the only common features of the two problems --- in most other respects (for example behaviour of solutions to resolvent problems) they behave differently.
This association between $\mathcal{A}^{\eps}$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{A}}^{\sigma}$ allows us to introduce the concept of \emph{resonance} that appears in the literature.
With the size of the period cell being unity in the setup of \cite{hempel2000spectral}, and the domain only having one free parameter, the material considered cannot be under critical contrast.
However it is under (or at) \emph{resonance} --- exactly one of the non-dimensional parameters describing this material ($\sigma=\lambda^{\mathrm{bulk}}$) is large, whilst the other parameters (in \eqref{eq:Intro-NonDimLengthScales}) are of order unity.
The term resonance typically brings with it connotations from more physically minded contexts; resonance is a phenomenon where the frequency of a periodic driving force is close to the natural frequency of the system on which it acts, causing a large spike in the amplitude of the response of the system.
This intuition still holds; the wavelength within the bulk $\lambda^{\mathrm{bulk}}$ has been ``driven" in response to the incident light of wavelength $\lambda_0$.
Through these two studies one can see a correspondence between materials under resonance and those at critical contrast --- both describe regimes in which the material exhibits dispersive effects.

The studies discussed above, whilst illustrative and helpful in demonstrating how it is possible for dissipative effects to emerge, still fall short of definitively establishing these effects as a direct consequence of being under critical contrast (or at resonance).
The work of \cite{cherednichenko2019unified, cherednichenko2019time} attempts to rectify this, looking to provide a more general theory analogous to that which already exists for the moderate (non-critical) contrast setting.
An key observation made in these works is that models with frequency dependent boundary conditions can be extended to conservative systems, and these ``extended" systems are precisely the asymptotic limits of models of high (or critical) contrast media. %\tstk{examples include Figotin-Schenker, and the aforementioned quantum graph limits of thin structures?}
We have already seen (section \ref{ssec:Intro-ThinStructures}) that such frequency-dependent problems and operators acting in extended spaces also emerge in the asymptotic limit of thin structure problems as the thickness of the structure tends to zero.
The same dispersive effects can thus be obtained from either geometric contrast (manifesting in the correct vertex-to-edge volume scaling, section \ref{ssec:Intro-ThinStructures}) or from materials under critical contrast or at resonance (corresponding to specific scalings of the material parameters).
Having the ability to obtain such effects through two different means is useful in contexts where one such contrast cannot be guaranteed, or is difficult to manufacture.
There is additional flexibility in the design process: if there are no suitable materials available to guarantee the correct material contrast to achieve a certain effect, alterations to the geometry might obtain the same effect, and vice-versa.
The relevance of our singular structure problems now extends beyond applications to thin structures --- if geometric contrast can mirror the effects of material contrast, then insights from our singular structure problems will also be informative and useful in the critical contrast context.
