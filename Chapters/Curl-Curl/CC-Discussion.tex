\subsection{On the Reduction to a Scalar System} \label{ssec:ReductionToScalar}
The reduction of the (vectorial) \eqref{eq:SingularCurlEquation} to a scalar system that resembles the acoustic approximation comes as a surprise.
This does not happen in the classical setting when one considers (either of) the curl of the curl equation \eqref{eq:Intro-CurlCurlEqns} on a periodic medium in the $\bracs{x_1,x_2}$-plane that is extruded into $x_3$, except in the case of oblique wave propagation --- when the propagation constant in the $x_3$ direction is zero.
Under these conditions, the Maxwell system reduces to the acoustic approximation, which was the focus of chapter \ref{ch:ScalarSystem}.
In our context, oblique wave propagation would correspond to the case when $\wavenumber=0$, however we observe reduction to the acoustic approximation regardless of the value of $\wavenumber$ --- warranting some thought.

The answer/reason lies in the nature of our variational problem itself --- specifically the dynamics induced by the tangential curls.
Let us imagine we now have a wave $u = u_0\e^{\rmi\vec{k}\cdot x}$ propagating in our material with wave-vector $\vec{k} = \qm_1\widehat{x}_1 + \qm_2\widehat{x}_2 + \wavenumber\widehat{x}_3$.
For each edge $I_{jk}$ (or plane $P_{jk}$) we can write this wave-vector using the local frame of reference provided by $\widehat{e}_{jk}$ and $\widehat{n}_{jk}$, obtaining $\vec{k}_{jk} := \qm_{jk}\widehat{e}_{jk} + \qm_{jk}^\perp\widehat{n}_{jk} + \wavenumber\widehat{x}_3$, where $\qm_{jk}^\perp := \qm\cdot n_{jk}$.
Now $\ktcurl{\dddmes}u$ on $I_{jk}$ is directed in the $\widehat{n}_{jk}$ direction, effectively only inducing dynamics or changes in $u$ in the $\widehat{e}_{jk}$ and $\widehat{x}_3$ directions.
There is no propagation out of the plane $P_{jk}$ as a result, which corresponds to when we have the component of $\vec{k}$ in the $\widehat{n}_{jk}$ direction being zero --- $\vec{k}\cdot\widehat{n}_{jk}=0$, which happens only if $\qm_{jk}^\perp=0$.
By analogy with the classical setting, one component of our wave-vector being zero will then result in the curl of the curl equation reducing to the acoustic approximation.
This occurs for each plane $P_{jk}$, and thus we find that our edge ODEs always reduce to the (singular analogue of the) acoustic approximation.
We also highlight that this is a direct consequence of the behaviour of the tangential curls on the particular geometry we have chosen to study --- there is no way to avoid such a reduction if one wishes to use the ``fibre-like" geometry considered here.
One could consider reworking the setup for the original variational problem \eqref{eq:SingularCurlEquation} (including the function spaces), however the reduction to the acoustic approximation is tied to the nature of our singular structure being \emph{singular} --- we are always going to effectively ``loose" the ability to observe wave propagation in one direction.
This observation also provides an idea for preventing automatic reduction to the acoustic approximation:  we need part of our domain to be non-singular, and we can do this by ``filling" the regions between the edges $I_{jk}$ with some background material.
Such a course of action does not come without its own complications, but we begin to pursue it in chapter \ref{ch:SingInc}.

\subsection{Remarks on the Calder\'on Operator} \label{ssec:CalderonOp}
In this section we look to draw further parallels between the curl-of-the-curl problem on a classical domain and the system \eqref{eq:QGRawSystem}.
One of our key motivating factors and themes throughout this work has been retaining an intuitive link between the spaces and objects necessary for studying variational problems on singular structures and their classical counterparts.
Further to this, we will demonstrate that the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator (the so-called $M$-operator) associated with the problem \eqref{eq:QGRawSystem} is a direct analogue of the Calder\'on operator, that is the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator for the curl of the curl equation.
The Dirichlet and Neumann maps for the classical curl of the curl problem motivate the definitions for their counterparts associated to the problem \eqref{eq:QGRawSystem}; and we will observe that the resulting maps form a boundary triple, providing us with an $M$-operator and thus a graph analogue of $\mathcal{C}$.

\tstk{might be the first time we talk about this, might move it into the $M$-matrix section of QGs, or even into the introductory section of this chapter if it reads better. Also did we mention boundary triples before??}
Let us quickly introduce the Calder\'{o}n operator; let $D\subset\reals^3$ be a domain, and define $\mathcal{A}$ as the curl of the curl operator
\begin{align*}
	\dom\bracs{\mathcal{A}} &= \clbracs{ u\in H^2_{\mathrm{curl}}(D) \setVert \hat{n}\wedge\curl{}u\vert_{\partial D} = m }, \\
	\mathcal{A}u &= \curl{}\bracs{\curl{}u},
\end{align*}
and the Dirichlet and Neumann maps ($\dmap$ and $\nmap$ respectively) by
\begin{align} \label{eq:ClassicalEM-DNMaps}
	\dmap u = u\vert_{\partial D}, \qquad
	\nmap u = \hat{n}\wedge\curl{u}\vert_{\partial D}.
\end{align}
We can quickly validate Green's identity:
\begin{align*}
	\integral{D}{ \mathcal{A}u \cdot \overline{v} - u \cdot \overline{\mathcal{A}v} }{x}
	&= \integral{D}{ \curl{}\bracs{\curl{}u}\cdot\overline{v} - u\cdot\overline{\curl{}\bracs{\curl{}v}} }{x} \\
	&= \integral{D}{ \curl{}u\cdot\overline{\curl{}v} - \curl{}u\cdot\overline{\curl{}v} }{x} \\
	&\quad + \integral{\partial D}{ \hat{n}\wedge\curl{}u\cdot\overline{v} - u\cdot\hat{n}\wedge\overline{\curl{}v} }{S} \\
	&= \integral{\partial D}{ \nmap u \cdot \overline{\dmap v} - \dmap u \cdot \overline{\nmap v} }{S},
\end{align*}
so $\bracs{\ltwo{\partial D}{S}^3, \dmap, \nmap}$ is a boundary triple for the operator $\mathcal{A}$, and we can talk about its associated Dirichlet-to-Neumann map (or $M$-operator).
This is the Calder\'{o}n operator $\mathcal{C}$, acting as
\begin{align*}
	u\vert_{\partial D} \rightarrow \hat{n}\wedge\bracs{\curl{}u}\vert_{\partial D}.
\end{align*}

Now let us turn to the quantum graph problem \eqref{eq:QGRawSystem}.
Given the definition of $\dmap$ in \eqref{eq:ClassicalEM-DNMaps}, we should expect that
\begin{align} \label{eq:DGMapDef}
	\dgmap u &= 
	\begin{pmatrix}
		u\bracs{v_1} \\ u\bracs{v_2} \\ \vdots \\ u\bracs{v_N}
	\end{pmatrix}
	\in\complex^{3N},
\end{align}
where we have stacked the 3-vectors on top of each other and set $N=\abs{\vertSet}$.
As for $\ngmap u$, this should be the analogue of $\nmap$ in \eqref{eq:ClassicalEM-DNMaps} --- only now the boundary of our domain is the vertices of $\graph$.
Define the functions \tstk{might be worth moving into our usual setup assumption for ease of use?}
\begin{align*}
	\sgn_{jk}: \clbracs{v_j, v_k} \rightarrow \clbracs{-1,0,1}, 
	&\qquad
	\sgn_{jk}(x) = \begin{cases} -1 & x=v_j, \\ 1 & x=v_k, \end{cases}
	&\qquad
	\hat{\sigma}_{jk} &= \sgn_{jk}\widehat{e}_{jk},
\end{align*}
so $\hat{\sigma}_{jk}$ is the ``exterior normal" to the edge $I_{jk}$.
The classical action of $\nmap$ in \eqref{eq:ClassicalEM-DNMaps} then suggests the following candidate for $\ngmap$:
\begin{align} \label{eq:NGMapDef}
	\ngmap u &= 
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\sum_{1\con k} \hat{\sigma}_{1k}\bracs{v_1}\wedge\ktcurl{\dddmes}u\bracs{v_1} \\
		\sum_{2\con k} \hat{\sigma}_{2k}\bracs{v_2}\wedge\ktcurl{\dddmes}u\bracs{v_2} \\
		\vdots \\
		\sum_{N\con k} \hat{\sigma}_{Nk}\bracs{v_N}\wedge\ktcurl{\dddmes}u\bracs{v_N}
	\end{pmatrix}
	\in\complex^{3N},
\end{align}
where we have again stacked the 3-vectors vertically.
From our analysis of $\kt$-tangential curls (corollary \ref{cory:TangCurlEdgeRotated}), we know that
\begin{align*}
	\ktcurl{\dddmes}u &= \bracs{ \bracs{ u_3^{(jk)} }' + \rmi\qm_{jk}u_3^{(jk)} - \rmi\wavenumber U_2^{(jk)} }\widehat{n}_{jk},
\end{align*}
on each edge $I_{jk}$.
Therefore, 
\begin{align*}
	\widehat{e}_{jk}\wedge\ktcurl{\dddmes}u &= \bracs{ \bracs{ u_3^{(jk)} }' + \rmi\qm_{jk}u_3^{(jk)} - \rmi\wavenumber U_2^{(jk)} }\widehat{x}_3
\end{align*}
on $I_{jk}$, and noticing that 
\begin{align*}
	\sum_{j\conRight k} U_2^{(kj)}\bracs{v_j} - \sum_{j\conLeft k} U_2^{(jk)}\bracs{v_j} &=
	\sum_{j\con k} \sgn_{jk}(v_j) U_2^{(jk)}\bracs{v_j},
\end{align*} 
we have for each $v_j\in\vertSet$,
\begin{align*}
	\sum_{j\con k} \hat{\sigma}_{jk}\bracs{v_j} \wedge \ktcurl{\dddmes}u\bracs{v_j}
	&= \bracs{ 
	\rmi\wavenumber\sum_{j\con k} \sgn_{jk}(v_j) U_2^{(jk)}\bracs{v_j}
	- \sum_{j\con k}\bracs{\pdiff{}{n} + \rmi\qm_{jk}}u_3^{(jk)}\bracs{v_j}
	} \widehat{x}_3.
\end{align*}
As such, we can now notice that the vertex conditions for the system \eqref{eq:QGRawSystem} can be written as
\begin{align} \label{eq:VertConditionExplicit}
	\sum_{j\con k} \hat{\sigma}_{jk}\bracs{v_j} \wedge \ktcurl{\dddmes}u\bracs{v_j}
	&= \alpha_j\omega^2 u\bracs{v_j},
	\qquad \forall v_j\in\vertSet.
\end{align}
We can identify \eqref{eq:VertConditionExplicit} as being of the form \eqref{eq:DispersiveBC} where
\begin{align*}
	\tilde{\alpha} = 
	\mathrm{diag}\bracs{\alpha_1, \alpha_1, \alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_2, \alpha_2, ..., \alpha_N, \alpha_N, \alpha_N} \in \complex^{3N\times 3N},
\end{align*}
and $\dgmap, \ngmap$ are as in \eqref{eq:DGMapDef}, \eqref{eq:NGMapDef}.
To complete the analogy, define the operator $\ag$ via the action
\begin{align*}
	\ag u &= 
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\sqbracs{ \rmi\wavenumber\bracs{\diff{}{y} + \rmi\qm_{jk} }u_3^{(jk)} + \wavenumber^2 U_2^{(jk)} }e_{jk}
		+ U_1^{(jk)} n_{jk} \\
		- \bracs{\diff{}{y} + \rmi\qm_{jk} }^2 u_3^{(jk)} + \rmi\wavenumber \bracs{\diff{}{y} + \rmi\qm_{jk} }U_2^{(jk)}
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
on each edge, where $\mathrm{dom}\bracs{\ag}$ consists of all functions $u$ with the following properties:
\begin{align*}
	u\in\mathrm{dom}\bracs{\ag} \quad\Leftrightarrow\quad &
	\begin{cases}
	u\in L^2\bracs{\graph}\times L^2\bracs{\graph}\times H^2\bracs{\graph}, \\
	U_2^{(jk)}\in \gradSob{I_{jk}}{y}, & \forall I_{jk}\in\edgeSet, \\
	u_3 \text{ is continuous at } v_j, & \forall v_j\in\vertSet, \\
	u_1(v_j) = u_2(v_j) = 0, & \forall v_j\in\vertSet, \\
	\text{\eqref{eq:QGVertexCondition} is satisfied at } v_j, & \forall v_j\in\vertSet.
	\end{cases}
\end{align*}
The eigenvalue problem for the operator $\ag$ is then \eqref{eq:QGRawSystem} and we have that
\begin{align*}
	\integral{I_{jk}}{ \ag u \cdot \overline{v} }{y} - \integral{I_{jk}}{ u \cdot \overline{\ag v} }{y}
	&= \sqbracs{ -u'_3 v_3 + u_3 v_3' - 2\rmi\qm_{jk}u_3 v_3 + \rmi\wavenumber\bracs{U_2 v_3 + u_3 V_2} }_{v_j}^{v_k} \\
	&= -\sqbracs{ \overline{v}_3\bracs{ \bracs{\diff{}{y} + \rmi\qm_{jk} }u_3 - \rmi\wavenumber U_2 } }_{v_j}^{v_k} \\
	&\qquad + \sqbracs{ u_3\overline{\bracs{ \bracs{\diff{}{y} + \rmi\qm_{jk} }v_3 - \rmi\wavenumber V_2 }} }_{v_j}^{v_k},
\end{align*}
implying
\begin{align*}
	&\ip{\ag u}{v}_{L^2\bracs{\graph}^3} - \ip{u}{\ag v}_{L^2\bracs{\graph}^3} \\
	&\quad = \sum_{v_j\in\vertSet}\sum_{j\conLeft k} \integral{I_{jk}}{ \ag u \cdot \overline{v} - u \cdot \overline{\ag v} }{y} \\
	&\quad = \sum_{v_j\in\vertSet}\sum_{j\conLeft k} -\sqbracs{ \overline{v}_3\bracs{ \bracs{\diff{}{y} + \rmi\qm_{jk} }u_3 - \rmi\wavenumber U_2 } }_{v_j}^{v_k}
	+ \sqbracs{ u_3\overline{\bracs{ \bracs{\diff{}{y} + \rmi\qm_{jk} }v_3 - \rmi\wavenumber V_2 }} }_{v_j}^{v_k} \\
	&\quad = \sum_{v_j\in\vertSet} u_3\bracs{v_j}\overline{\bracs{ \sum_{j\con k}\bracs{\pdiff{}{n} + \rmi\qm_{jk}}v_3 - \rmi\wavenumber\sum_{j\con k} \sgn_{jk}(v_j) V_2^{(jk)}\bracs{v_j} }} \\
	&\quad + \sum_{v_j\in\vertSet} \overline{v}_3\bracs{v_j}\bracs{ \sum_{j\con k}\bracs{\pdiff{}{n} + \rmi\qm_{jk}}u_3 - \rmi\wavenumber\sum_{j\con k} \sgn_{jk}(v_j) U_2^{(jk)}\bracs{v_j} } \\
	&\quad = \ngmap u \cdot \overline{\dgmap v} - \dgmap u \cdot \overline{\ngmap v}
	= \ip{\ngmap u}{\dgmap v}_{\complex^{3N}} - \ip{\dgmap u}{\ngmap v}_{\complex^{3N}},
\end{align*}
and so the Green's identity holds. \tstk{do we even define a boundary triple in the QG chapter? If so, saying "green's identity" doesn't make much sense!}
Therefore, $\bracs{\complex^{3N}, \dgmap, \ngmap}$ is a boundary triple for the operator $\ag$.
Given \eqref{eq:ClassicalEM-DNMaps} served as the motivations for the definitions \eqref{eq:DGMapDef} and \eqref{eq:NGMapDef}, the $M$-operator associated with \eqref{eq:QGRawSystem} really is a ``graph version" of the Calder\'on operator for the problem \eqref{eq:SingularCurlEquation}.

\subsection{Open Questions} \label{ssec:CC-OpenQuestions}
\tstk{comment at end - Whilst it is not known whether the problem \eqref{eq:SingularCurlEquation} is the ``limit" of a thin-structure problem with thick vertices, in the sense of \tstk{scalar SS problem to scalar TS problem, via KZ and EP}, the motivation for our consideration of such variational problems stems from the coincidence? Might go in a future directions/ open questions subsection instead}

Given that our investigation into the curl of the curl equation has resulted in us obtaining the acoustic approximation, it is natural to consider stepping back to a variational problem for the general Maxwell system;
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:CC-Maxwell1stOrder}
	\begin{align}
		\ktdiv{\dddmes}\cdot E = 0,
		&\qquad
		\ktcurl{*}E = \rmi\omega\mu_m H, \\
		\ktdiv{\dddmes}\cdot H = 0,
		&\qquad
		\ktcurl{*}H = -\rmi\omega\epsilon_m E,
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
for the purpose of illustration, we will assume the material parameters are constants. 
A thorough analysis would establish a formal definition for the Maxwell operator, the eigenvalue problem for which corresponds to \eqref{eq:CC-Maxwell1stOrder}, which we interpret as the problem of finding divergence-free $E,H\in\pltwo{\ddom}{\dddmes}^3$ such that
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:CC-Maxwell1stOrderVariational}
	\begin{align} 
		\integral{\ddom}{ E\cdot\overline{\ktcurl{}\phi} - \rmi\omega\mu_m H\cdot\overline{\phi} }{\dddmes} &= 0, 
		\qquad &\forall \phi\in\psmooth{\ddom}^3, \\
		\integral{\ddom}{ H\cdot\overline{\ktcurl{}\psi} + \rmi\omega\epsilon_m E\cdot\overline{\psi} }{\dddmes} &= 0,
		\qquad &\forall \psi\in\psmooth{\ddom}^3.
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
One has to answer a number of new questions when attempting to examine the first order Maxwell operator.
Definition \ref{def:DivFree-AllGradients} translates directly into the first order context, but we write the ``curls" in \eqref{eq:CC-Maxwell1stOrder} with a subscript asterisk to distinguish them from the tangential curls that belong to fields in $\ktcurlSob{\ddom}{\dddmes}$.
Unlike in \eqref{eq:SingularCurlEquation}, the curl appears as a first-order operator in \eqref{eq:CC-Maxwell1stOrder}, and so there is no guarantee that the object $\ktcurl{*}E$ coincides with $E\in\ktcurlSob{\ddom}{\dddmes}$.
Indeed, the objects $\ktcurl{*}E$ and $\ktcurl{*}H$ in \eqref{eq:CC-Maxwell1stOrder} are only really ``defined" upon determining a solution $E,H$ to \eqref{eq:CC-Maxwell1stOrderVariational}.
Circumnavigating these issues and performing an analysis of the resulting system is the natural next step in pursuit of understanding the Maxwell system on singular structures, and the behaviour of the modes supported by such structures.
There is also the related question of whether the singular curl of the curl equation \eqref{eq:SingularCurlEquation} would still be a consequence of the more general (singular) Maxwell system \eqref{eq:CC-Maxwell1stOrder} that is defined.
More precisely, is it true that a solution $E,H$ to \eqref{eq:CC-Maxwell1stOrder} gives rise to a solution $\bracs{u, \ktcurl{\dddmes}u }\in\ktcurlSob{\ddom}{\dddmes}$ to \eqref{eq:SingularCurlEquation}? \tstk{here}
