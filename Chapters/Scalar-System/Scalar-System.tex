\tstk{the Sob spaces stuff is all done with $\kt$ grads, even though in this chapter we only need $\theta$ grads. This is largely to avoid repetition in the following chapter, but does mean that we are doing more work than necessary here. It also means things appear backwards, as we first did $\theta$-grads as motivation/a basis for then considering $\kt$-grads, curls, and divergence (free). TLDR; I could change this to $\theta$-grads and move $\kt$-grads to chapter 4's appendix, only do $\kt$-grads here and not do them in chapter 4, or any other sensible policy.}
