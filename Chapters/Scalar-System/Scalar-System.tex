\chapter{Scalar Equation}
\tstk{title name of chapter needs redoing once you have an idea for what to change it to!}

\tstk{this content is copy-pasted from the Paper\_Scalar file, and might need notational adjustments to be bought into line with the rest of the thesis. In particular, all the theory etc is done by first considering edges parallel to the $x_1$-axis, whilst the curl chapter goes for parallel to $x_2$. These will need to be reconciled.}

\tstk{theory on Sob spaces... this goes here, it's own chapter? It's own appendix???}
