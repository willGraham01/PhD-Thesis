\chapter{Preliminaries and Theory} \label{ch:TheoryPrelims}
Throughout this work there will be a number of common themes and conventions whose content is not specific to one particular chapter or research problem.
To avoid redirecting the reader to a number of different points in this work, and in the interest of preventing chapters \ref{ch:ScalarSystem}, \ref{ch:CurlCurl}, and \ref{ch:SingInc} becoming bloated with further introductions and notational conventions, we provide an introduction to the key concepts that will be prevalent throughout.

In section \ref{sec:TP-GelfandTransform}, we introduce the Gelfand transform and the resulting ``shifted gradient" operators $\tgrad, \ktgrad$.
Section \ref{sec:QuantumGraphs} contains the notation we will use, and theory that we will require, from the field of quantum graphs.
This covers how we will choose to represent our ``singular structures" (section \ref{ssec:EmbeddedGraphs}), how one defines differential operators on (metric) graphs (sections \ref{ssec:QG-FunctionSpaces}-\ref{ssec:DiffOpsOnGraphs}), and a valuable tool for the analysis of the spectrum of such operators --- the $M$-matrix (section \ref{ssec:MMatrix}).
The introduction of embedded graphs will then allow us to define the singular measures of interest to us in section \ref{sec:SingularMeasures}, before moving on to the definition of the ``non-classical" Sobolev spaces (section \ref{sec:BorelMeasSobSpaces}) that will be the backbone of the variational problems we consider in later chapters.
