\chapter{Preliminaries and Theory} \label{ch:TheoryPrelims}
There will be a number of common themes touched upon in this work that are not specific to one particular chapter or research problem.
To avoid constantly redirecting the reader, and in the interest of preventing chapters \ref{ch:ScalarSystem}, \ref{ch:CurlCurl}, and \ref{ch:SingInc} becoming bloated with further introductions and notational conventions, we provide an introduction to the key concepts that will be prevalent throughout.

In section \ref{sec:TP-GelfandTransform}, we introduce the Gelfand transform and the resulting ``shifted gradient" operators $\tgrad, \ktgrad$.
Section \ref{sec:QuantumGraphs} contains the notation we will use, and theory that we will require, from the field of quantum graphs.
This in particular includes how we will choose to represent our ``singular structures" (section \ref{ssec:EmbeddedGraphs}), how one defines differential operators on (metric) graphs (sections \ref{ssec:QG-FunctionSpaces}-\ref{ssec:DiffOpsOnGraphs}), and the $M$-matrix (section \ref{ssec:MMatrix}).
The introduction of embedded graphs will then allow us to define the singular measures of interest to us (section \ref{sec:SingularMeasures}), before moving on to the definition of the ``non-classical" Sobolev spaces (section \ref{sec:BorelMeasSobSpaces}) that will be the backbone of the variational problems we consider in later chapters.

Before we begin, we set out some notation for frequently occurring function spaces.
Let $\ddom\subset\reals^d$, and denote by $\smooth{\ddom}$ the set of infinitely differentiable (\emph{smooth}) functions on $\ddom$, $\csmooth{\ddom}$ the set of smooth functions with compact support in the interior of $\ddom$, and $\psmooth{\ddom}$ the set of infinitely differentiable functions on $\reals^d$ that are $\ddom$-periodic.
For a Borel measure $\rho$ on $\ddom$, denote by $\ltwo{\ddom}{\rho}$ the space of $\rho$-square-integrable functions on $\ddom$.
If the measure is omitted, it is taken to be the $d$-dimensional Lebesgue measure on $\ddom$.
An exception to this will be cases where we are considering an interval $I\subset\reals$ equipped with the Lebesgue measure; where due to notational conventions for our singular structures we will write $\ltwo{I}{y}$ for the space of square integrable functions on this interval, and similarly write $\gradSob{I}{y}$ for the (Sobolev) space of $u\in\ltwo{I}{y}$ that possess a weak derivative $u'\in\ltwo{I}{y}$.
If $\ddom$ is the unit cell of some periodic structure, we also think of $\ltwo{\ddom}{\rho}$ as the space of $\rho$-square integrable functions on the torus homeomorphic to $\ddom$, and of course $\psmooth{\ddom}$ as the space of smooth functions on the torus.
Finally, for vector fields $u\in\ltwo{\ddom}{\rho}^d$, a subscript $u_i$ denotes the $i^{\text{th}}$ component of $u$.
