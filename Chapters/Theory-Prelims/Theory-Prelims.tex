\chapter{Preliminaries and Theory} \label{ch:TheoryPrelims}
\tstk{make this title more focused when the time comes.}

Purpose of this chapter is largely to introduce the two major tools we employ (plus any more that the singular-inclusion chapter/1st order Maxwell throws up) --- Quantum Graphs (and the M-matrix) and the singular structure spaces/definitions.

In hindsight, this section will likely be made into two chapters (or at least, multiple sections) to accomodate the quantum graph preliminaries.
The Sob Space stuff isn't as bloated, since our interest in a general measure quickly pales once we establish our measures $\dddmes, \ddmes, \nu$.
