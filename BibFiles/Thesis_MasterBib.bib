% CONVERGENCE TO QUANTUM GRAPHS

%% Extends Kuchment-Zeng (2001) in the sense that additional geometric parameters will affect the resulting spectral limits

%% Developed before EP (2005), K-Z study the convergence of the eigenvalues of the Neumann laplacian to the eigenvalues of a quantum graph problem
%% They do not prove anything stronger (such as norm-resolvent convergence), which makes the link between the thin-structure problems and QG problems kind of coincidental, until this was proven later.

% Elasticity on thin structures and the corresponding limits

%% Proves a homogenisation principle for singular structure problems in elasticity
%% Introduces the motivation for our own Sobolev spaces

%% Studies the homogenisation limit for a thin structure whose thickness \sim the vanishing period \eps.

% CONCERNING QUANTUM GRAPHS IN THE LITERATURE

%Introduction to Quantum Graphs, G. Berkolaiko and P. Kuchment
%% Textbook that was written to lay some common foundations for the theory of quantum graphs, and to outline some of the most essential techniques used to study them.
%% This is a good, ``classical" reference to provide for a person wanting to get started in the study of quantum graph problems.
